# What is System Testing?
System testing, also known as system-level testing or system integration testing, is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle. It's where the QA team steps in to assess how all the individual components of your application work together as a whole. Imagine it as the final orchestra rehearsal before the big performance –  everything needs to be harmonized for a flawless experience.

System testing goes beyond simply verifying individual features. It's a black-box approach, meaning the testers focus on the application's functionality from the user's perspective, not the intricate internal workings (that's white-box testing territory). The goal? To ensure every kind of user input produces the expected outcome across the entire application.

Think of it this way: system testing is like testing all the gears in a complex machine –  do they mesh seamlessly to generate the desired output?  This rigorous process typically happens after integration testing, where individual modules are tested for compatibility, and before acceptance testing, where users get their hands on the application. 
## What is end to end testing?
In software development, "end-to-end" (E2E) testing signifies a comprehensive approach that evaluates a system or application from the very beginning to the very end, mimicking a real user's experience. Imagine a user logging in, navigating menus, performing specific actions, and receiving the desired outcome. E2E testing meticulously replicates this entire user journey, ensuring all the interconnected components seamlessly collaborate to deliver the expected functionality.

While system testing focuses on verifying how individual parts of the application work together like well-oiled gears, E2E testing builds upon that foundation. It takes the integrated system for a spin, checking if it delivers a smooth and cohesive user experience across all functionalities.

Here's a helpful analogy: system testing is like ensuring the orchestra members are playing their parts correctly. E2E testing goes beyond that, guaranteeing the entire symphony comes together to create a harmonious and impactful performance for the audience.

E2E testing often leverages automated testing tools to simulate user actions. These tools meticulously validate the system's response throughout the entire workflow, mimicking real-world user interactions. This comprehensive approach helps identify issues that might go undetected during isolated unit or integration testing, where the focus is on individual components or their immediate interactions. By simulating real user journeys, E2E testing acts as a final dress rehearsal before the software hits the stage, uncovering potential glitches that could disrupt the user experience.
System testing ensures the internal machinery runs smoothly, while E2E testing verifies that this well-oiled machine translates to a flawless user experience from start to finish. 
## Importance of system testing
System testing, often overshadowed by flashier stages of development, plays a crucial role in ensuring a software product functions flawlessly. Just like a well-rehearsed play requires a seamless interaction between actors and crew, system testing verifies how all the individual components of your application work together as a cohesive whole. Here's why it's an essential step in the software development lifecycle:

## Phases of system testing
System testing, the critical phase where an application transforms from a collection of components into a cohesive whole, demands a meticulously planned and executed process. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key stages involved:

1. **Test Environment Setup:**  Before the testing symphony begins, the stage needs to be set. This involves establishing a dedicated test environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible. This test environment serves as the playground for executing test cases and identifying potential issues. Here, the QA team configures test servers, databases, and any necessary network infrastructure.

2. **Test Case Design and Development:**  The foundation for successful testing lies in meticulously crafted test cases. These test cases define a series of actions and expected outcomes that systematically evaluate the application's functionality, performance, security, and usability.  The QA team meticulously analyzes requirements documents, user stories, and functional specifications to create these test cases. They ensure each test case covers a specific aspect of the application's behavior and includes both positive and negative test scenarios.

3. **Test Data Preparation:**  Just like actors need props for a play, testers need data to interact with the application during testing. This stage involves generating realistic test data that simulates real-world user interactions.  The data can be a combination of manual creation and automated data population tools. The key is to ensure the test data reflects various scenarios and user behaviors the application might encounter in production.

4. **Test Case Execution:**  With the environment prepared, test cases designed, and data loaded, it's time for the real action. The QA team meticulously executes the test cases, meticulously following the predefined steps and recording the actual outcomes.  This stage may involve a combination of manual and automated testing techniques, depending on the complexity of the application and the test cases themselves.

5. **Defect Reporting and Management:**  Inevitably, during test execution, discrepancies between expected and actual results will surface.  These discrepancies, known as defects, need to be documented efficiently. The QA team logs each defect, capturing details such as the specific test case, the observed behavior, and the expected outcome. This information is crucial for developers to diagnose and rectify the problems.

6. **Regression Testing:**  Just like a house built upon a shaky foundation, an application with unresolved defects risks future complications. Regression testing ensures that bug fixes haven't introduced any unintended side effects.  A subset of previously executed test cases, particularly those related to the fixed defects, are re-run to verify the application's stability and functionality after the fixes have been implemented.

7. **Defect Resolution and Retesting:**  The reported defects don't simply disappear – they demand attention. Developers analyze the defect reports, diagnose the root cause of the issue, and implement the necessary fixes.  Once a fix is implemented, the associated test case is re-executed (retesting) to confirm that the defect has indeed been resolved. This iterative process of defect identification, resolution, and retesting continues until all critical defects are addressed.

8. **Test Completion and Reporting:**  Once a predefined set of test cases have been executed, defects addressed, and regression testing completed, the system testing phase nears its conclusion. The QA team prepares a comprehensive test report that summarizes the testing effort, including the number of test cases executed, identified defects, and their severity levels. This report serves as a crucial document for stakeholders, providing insights into the application's quality and readiness for production deployment.

## How E2E testing builds upon System testing  

System testing and End-to-End (E2E) testing are both crucial phases in the software development lifecycle, but they serve distinct purposes and build upon each other. Here's a detailed explanation of how E2E testing complements and expands upon the groundwork laid by system testing:

**System Testing: The Building Blocks**

Imagine system testing as meticulously constructing the individual components of a house – the walls, the roof, the plumbing, and the electrical wiring. Each component is rigorously tested to ensure it functions as intended. This phase focuses on verifying the internal workings and interactions between various modules of the application. It employs a black-box approach, meaning testers interact with the application from a user's perspective, unaware of the intricate internal code.

**E2E Testing: The User Journey Experience**

E2E testing, on the other hand, takes the constructed house and simulates a walkthrough – a real user experience. It mimics how a user would interact with the application from start to finish, performing a series of actions and validating the expected outcomes across the entire system. It's like inviting someone to walk through your newly built house, checking if all the doors open, lights turn on, and water flows smoothly.

**Building Upon the Foundation**

Here's how E2E testing leverages the groundwork laid by system testing:

* **System Testing as the Prerequisite:**  E2E testing relies on a stable and well-functioning system as its foundation. System testing ensures individual components work as intended and interact seamlessly before E2E testing can comprehensively evaluate the user experience.

* **Focus on User Experience:**  While system testing verifies the functionality of individual parts, E2E testing focuses on how those parts work together to deliver a cohesive and user-friendly experience. It identifies issues that might go undetected during system testing, such as inconsistencies in data flow or navigation flow across different modules.

* **Integration and Interaction:**  System testing ensures modules work together, but E2E testing goes a step further. It validates how user interactions with various functionalities trigger seamless responses across the entire system. Imagine flipping a light switch (user interaction) and verifying the light turns on (expected response) – not just that the light bulb and switch are functional individually.

* **Real-World Scenarios:**  E2E testing often leverages automated tools to simulate real-world user journeys. This helps uncover issues that might not be apparent during isolated unit or integration testing. It's like testing the house under real-life conditions, simulating how users would interact with it in their daily lives.
